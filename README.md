# jlox
Java implementation of Lox from Crafting Interpreters

## Build and run instructions
To build, you must either have bazel or nix installed.  To use nix, enable flakes, run `nix develop` and then follow the bazel steps.  If you have bazel installed globally, simply use `bazel run //:jlox` to run the interactive interpreter.
